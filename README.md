# LazyNotes
This is a simple note-taking app that aims to make notes even lazier.

Features to add (short term):
 - [x] Preserve fragments after rotations
 - [ ] Save notes upon exiting (if changed)
 - [ ] Use asynchronous tasks to call data
 - [ ] Add a loading screen
    
Features to add (long term):
   - Support for larger devices
    
Refactoring to do:
 - [ ] Make getting the savedInstanceState from the current fragment simpler     
    
I'm taking this project to learn the following concepts:
- [x] Creating content providers manually
- Refactoring Code
- Testing all parts of the process such as
    - [x] Testing Recycler Views with Instrumental Tests
    - [x] Testing POJO (Plain Old Java Objects) with Unit Testing
    - [ ] Testing Asynchronous calls to the database
    - etc..
    
- I hope to refactor this code to involve libraries that would replace boilerplate code as part of this learning process such as:
    - Room
    - Firebase or any other cloud-based database
