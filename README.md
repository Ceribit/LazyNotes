# LazyNotes
This is a simple note-taking app that aims to make notes even lazier.

I'm taking this project to learn the following concepts:
- Creating content providers manually
- Refactoring Code
- Testing all parts of the process such as
    - Testing Recycler Views with Instrumental Tests
    - Testing POJO (Plain Old Java Objects) with Unit Testing
    - Testing Asynchronous calls to the database
    - etc..
    
- I hope to refactor this code to involve libraries that would replace boilerplate code as part of this learning process such as:
    - Room
    - Firebase or any other cloud-based database
